# Summary-03

## Completed Projects
1. **guess_random_number.py** - Number guessing game with conditional logic
2. **multiplication_table.py** - Multiplication table using nested loops

## Key Concepts Mastered
- `import random` and `random.randint()` for random numbers
- Nested `while` loops for complex iterations
- Loop variables and increment operations (`i += 1`)
- Formatted string output with tabs (`\t`)
- Conditional logic within loop structures

## Technical Progress
- Advanced conditional branching techniques
- Loop control flow and iteration management
- Program state management with multiple attempts
- Complex output formatting in table structures
